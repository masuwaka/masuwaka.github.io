Welcome to my technical notes.

I document practical insights from working with AI systems, network infrastructure, and software development. These are real-world implementations and troubleshooting guides based on hands-on experience.

**Focus areas:**
- AI system deployment and optimization
- Linux system administration and automation
- Network configuration and DNS management
- Signal processing applications
- Development tools and best practices

Expect detailed tutorials, configuration examples, and technical deep-dives.
